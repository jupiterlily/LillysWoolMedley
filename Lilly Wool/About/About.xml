  <description>Ever wondered why you can't shear shearable animals before you butcher them? Well, now you can! When you butcher a wooly animal it will drop a wool pile which can be processed into some useable wool. Adds wool piles and processing for woolly vanilla animals. Now rebalanced (yield is only about half of a normal shearing) and with compatibility for (Slightly) More Realistic Wool Production.</description>
